Title: Optimization of Formulation Parameters for Nucleic Acid Drug Development
Author: Randall Meyer
Date: May 6, 2025

Description: This project contains multiple files corresponding to the data analysis of a formulation scree for nucleic acid delivery.  The main file is the "meyer_randall_final_report.rmd" file and the associated "meyer_randall_final_report.html" rendered report.  The project folder also contains a Data sub directory with all raw data files used in the analysis, and an Output folder with the final data frame used for analysis (all_data.csv) and exported figure files as .jpg.  A codebook is also given in the main directory as Codebook.docx which contains explanations of all variables in the all_data data frame.  The R project, current R workspace, and R history are also saved in the main directory.  A customized function written from one of the packages used in the analysis is also saved as an R script file.  

Installation: The most up to date version of R (4.5.0) and R Studio (2025.05.0+496) as of this writing should be installed to read and render the html report from the R Markdown file.  The .html report can be viewed with any web browser, including Google Chrome.  All R packages required to run the code in the R Markdown are installed if needed from the CRAN repository during code execution. 

Usage: This project can be modified given knowledge of the R language and HTML.  Full understanding of the project objectives and variables considered as given in the .html report is required to make meaningful modifications to the data analysis.
